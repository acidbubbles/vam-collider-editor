# Virt-A-Mate Collider Editor

This is a rewrite with permission from acidbubbles of his plugin 'ColliderTuner', the original plugin was written from the perspective of manipulating RigidBodies. After a discussion on VaM Discord it turns out that Colliders should be the focus and the plugin was re-written    based on that discussion. 

This (hopefully) fixed a host of issues around the identification of specific colliders so they can be saved and restored.

[Download](https://github.com/acidbubbles/vam-collider-tuner/releases) and put the `.var` file in your `AddonPackages` folder.
